# vagrant-save

This is a simple plugin to export boxes into .box files using [vagrant-export](https://github.com/trenker/vagrant-export) and pushes that file to a  [boxserver](https://github.com/trenker/boxserver) instance.

## Installation

Like with any other vagrant plugin:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-save
```

## Usage

Have a [boxserver](https://github.com/trenker/boxserver) instance running and set the property `config.vm.box_server_url` to its address in your vagrant file. So your `Vagrantfile` contains the following statements:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # This must be set
  config.vm.box_server_url = "http://localhost:8001"
end
```

Then just run

```bash
vagrant save
```

to release a new version of your box.

By default, it increases the bugfix version number by one. So an installed 1.0.0 becomes 1.0.1. You can specify the version yourself using the parameter `-v|--version`, like this:

```bash
vagrant save -v 1.2.0
```

The parameter must always have all three digits and must be greater than the installed version.

You may want to clean up the boxserver by deleting old versions. The `-k|--keep` parameter sets how many versions to keep. The versions are sorted in descending order, older than the newest X will be deleted:

```bash
# Keeping the last six versions
vagrant save -k 6

# Keeping all versions
# Does not need to be written, as it is the default setting
vagrant save -k 0
```
